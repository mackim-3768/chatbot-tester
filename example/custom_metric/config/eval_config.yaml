    # The 'path' can be a python file path or a module path.
    # We will pass the absolute path in the run script or rely on PYTHONPATH.
    # For this example, we assume the user passes the plugin path via CLI --plugin argument,
    # and here we just refer to the registered name if we registered it manually, 
    # OR if we use the plugin loader, we need to know how it registers the name.
    # The PluginLoader loads the module. If the module has a 'register_metrics' function or similar, it runs it.
    # Or if we use the convention where the CLI loads the plugin, and the config refers to the 'type' defined in the plugin.
    
    # Wait, the current system might expect a specific setup.
    # Let's look at `chatbot_tester/evaluator/plugin.py` or similar if needed.
    # Assuming standard plugin system: we need to register it.
    # The CLI has `--plugin`. 
    # In `keyword_metric.py`, we need to actually register it to the registry.
    
    # Let's update the python file to register itself when imported.
    # But for now let's write the config assuming 'keyword_presence' type becomes available.
